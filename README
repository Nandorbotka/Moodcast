🧩 Environment Setup Guide

If you clone this repository and want to run Moodcast locally, you’ll need to set up your own API keys.  
For security reasons, the `.env` files (which store these keys) are **not included** in the repository.

Follow these simple steps to make it work:

### 1️⃣ Create `.env` files from the examples

In both the **frontend** and **backend** folders, you’ll find `.env.example` files.

Copy them and rename to `.env`:

```bash
# In the backend folder
cp .env.example .env

# In the frontend folder
cp .env.example .env

#Add your API keys

    -- moodcast/backend/.env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
    WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key_here
    PORT=3000

    -- moodcast/frontend/.env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Start backend
cd moodcast/backend
npm run start

# Start frontend (in a new terminal)
cd moodcast/frontend
npm run dev
